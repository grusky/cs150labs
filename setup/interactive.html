            In this guide, you will learn how to use the interactive Python shell.
        </p>

        <p>
            For most assignments in the class, you will be required to write out full Python programs in a text editor (<a href="../lab01/lab01.html">see Lab 1 for more about Komodo Edit</a>). However, it is often useful to test out small chunks of code to see how they work. The interactive Python shell is a perfect tool for this job.
        </p>

        <p>
            Don't worry if you don't understand the code used on this page yet! You will soon!
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Note:</b> If you are using a Mac, you must <a href="python.html">install Python first</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Running the Python Shell</h2>

        <p>
            Open a terminal and type <tt>python3</tt> without any arguments instead of supplying a file name. Instead of running a program, it will display a slightly different looking prompt. This will let you run lines of Python code instead of the usual terminal commands you use.
        </p>

        <h2>Simple Expressions</h2>

        <p>
            The Python shell will evaluate simple arithmetic expressions, function calls, or print statements, and show the result.
        </p>

        <h2>Using Indentation</h2>

        <p>
            Later on in this course, you will work with loops and conditional statements. Python uses indentation to determine whether a line of code is inside or outside one of these blocks.
        </p>

        <p>
            The interactive Python shell will tell you when you may want to indent your code by changing the prompt from <tt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</tt> to <tt>...</tt>.
        </p>

        <img alt="Python prompt change" src="ellipsis.png" />

        <p>
            If you want to continue the <tt>if</tt> statement, indent the line by pressing the tab key, as you would in a standard text editor. If you do not press the tab key, Python will assume the next line of code is not meant to be in the block.
        </p>

        <img alt="Multi-level indentation" src="indent.png" />

        <p>
            You can also write blocks within blocks by pressing the tab key multiple times. If you have been using Komodo Edit, this should be familiar to you.
        </p>

        <h2>Exiting the Python Shell</h2>

        <p>To exit the Python shell, type <tt>exit()</tt> and hit return or type Control-D.</p>
