The purpose of this lab is to:
</p><ul>
	<li>Practice creating classes
	</li><li>Learn how to work with client code (aka how to "let go of the controls")
	</li><li>Build the ultimate fighting critter
</li></ul>
<p></p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>
Before you begin, please create a folder called <tt>lab09</tt> inside your <tt>cs150</tt> folder. This is where you should put all files made for this lab.
</p>


<h3>Getting the Files</h3>

<p>

Then download the <a href="./lab09files.tar">starter files</a> into
    this folder and unpack it.
</p>

<pre>    # somehow get the file <a href="./lab09files.tar">lab09files.tar</a> into ~/cs150/lab09 and go to this directory

    % <span class="typed">tar xvf lab09files.tar</span>

    % <span class="typed">ls</span>
</pre>

<p>
You should now have the files <tt>color.py</tt>, <tt>critter_gui.py</tt>, <tt>critter_main.py</tt>, <tt>critter_model.py</tt>, and <tt>critter.py</tt>.
These classes implement a graphical simulation of a 2D grid world with
many animals moving around in it. Different kinds of animals move in 
different ways; as you write each class, you are defining those 
differences.
</p>

<h2>Program Summary</h2>

<p>
Before you start, let's take a look at this animal world, an example of 
which is shown below. You can see this world yourself by running <tt>critter_main</tt>.
</p>
<pre>    % <span class="typed">python3 critter_main.py</span>
</pre>

<img src="safari.jpg" align="middle" border="1" width="95%">


<p>
At the beginning, you will see an empty grid with no animals.
The <tt>Play</tt> button starts the simulation; initially there is nothing
to simulate so the `clock' will just run with nothing happening (you
may see some numbers appear on the board--we'll get to those later). The 
stuff goes down once you have some critters on your board. 
</p>

<p>
On each round of the simulation, every critter is asked which direction 
it wants to move. Its choices are to move one square to the
north, south, east, west, or stay at its current location. Critters 
move around in a world of finite size, but the world is toroidal as in 
the Life lab (going off the end to the right brings you back to the left
and vice versa; going off the end to the top brings you back to the 
bottom and vice versa). 
</p>

<p>
The critter world is divided into cells that have integer coordinates. 
There are 60 cells across and 50 cells up and down. The upper-left cell 
has coordinates (0,0), increasing <tt>x</tt> values moves you right and increasing <tt>y</tt> values move you down (similar to the <tt>picture</tt> module).
</p>

<p>
There are some other buttons that may be helpful as well.  <tt>Turn</tt> will run a single turn, in which every critter will move once. <tt>Tick</tt> will move only the next critter to move.  <tt>Reset</tt> will reset the world to its initial state. There are also a number of helpful command line arguments.  Run <tt>python3 critter_main.py --help</tt> to see a description of them. </p>


<p>
This program may be confusing at first because 
you are not writing the <tt>main</tt> 
function (the client code that uses your animal objects), 
therefore your code will not be in control of the overall 
program's execution.  Instead, you are defining a series of 
objects that become part of a larger system.  For example, you might find that you want to have one of your critters make 
several moves all at once---you won't be able to do that.  The only way a critter can move is to wait for the simulator to 
ask it for a move.  Although this experience can be frustrating, it is a good introduction to the kind of programming we do 
with objects. 
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the simulation, each critter is asked to supply an attack and a defense value that it will use for the
entire game via its <tt>getStats</tt> method; these values cannot be changed once they are set, as they are kept track of in the <tt>critter_model</tt> module and not your own critter. As the simulation runs, animals may collide by moving onto
the same location. When two animals collide, they fight using their attack and defense values. If the attacking critter is
successful in killing its opponent, the loser is removed from the simulation and the attacker is allowed to move into their
spot. Otherwise, both critters remain in the simulation where they were before.
</p>

<p>
Each critter starts off with 50 health points. Their attack and defense values can be anywhere between 0 and 100, but the
sum of both cannot be greater than 100. When two critters fight, the moving critter is registered as the attacking critter
and the other is the defender. The defense of the defender is subtracted from the attack of the attacker, and if the result
is positive, it is then subtracted from the health of the defending critter. If the defending critter's health reaches or
goes below 0, they are are killed. If not, they survive the attack. A 2x bonus is awarded to the defense of a critter whose
last move was to stay still. For the first round, every critter that has not yet moved receives this bonus.

<h2>Provided Files</h2>


<p>
Each critter you implement must have some specific state and 
functionality defined. In particular, each of the classes you'll write 
(one class per animal) will be a subclass of the following provided <tt>critter</tt> class:
</p>

<div class="boxed">
	<pre><tt>
# Constants for movement.
N = "NORTH"
S = "SOUTH"
E = "EAST"
W = "WEST"
C = "CENTER"
DIRECTIONS = ("NORTH", "EAST", "SOUTH", "WEST", "CENTER")

    
class Critter():
    
    # methods to be implemented
    def getColor(self):
        pass
    def getMove(self, info):
        pass
    def getStats(self):
        pass
    def getChar(self):
        pass
    # this method is called by the client prog when a fight is over
    # since the client prog knows who won the fight, when it calls
    # this method, it passes in true for the kill parameter if the
    # defending critter was killed, and false otherwise.
    # oppFight is the opponent's attack and defense stats, as well
    # as their remaining health.
    # The purpose of this information is to allow you to learn strategies.
    def fightOver(self, kill, oppFight):
        pass
</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>
Because your classes inherit from the superclass, they will be able to 
refer to the Critter defined constants. Moreover, each class must 
include a definition for each of the methods in the 
superclass (<tt>getStats</tt>, <tt>getColor</tt>, <tt>getMove</tt>, <tt>getChar</tt>, and <tt>fightOver</tt>) for which it wants different (i.e. not default) behavior.  For example, below is a definition for a class called <tt>Stone</tt> that is 
part of the simulation.  Stone objects are displayed with the letter <tt>S</tt>, are gray in color, always stay on the current location 
(returning <tt>CENTER</tt> for their move), and have <tt>0</tt> attack and <tt>100</tt> defense. 
</p>

<div class="boxed">
	<pre><tt>
import critter
import color

class Stone(critter.Critter):
    
    def getChar(self):
        return "S"
    
    def getColor(self):
        return color.GRAY
    
    def getMove(self, info):
        return critter.C
    
    def getStats(self):
        return 0, 100

    # we don't have a fightOver method here, because a 
    # Stone doesn't do anything with this information
    # i.e. it doesn't care to change the default behavior
</tt></pre><tt>
</tt>
</div>

<p> Add this code to a file called <tt>stone.py</tt>, then run <tt>critter_main</tt>. Now you should see some stones in your world. Of course, <tt>Stone</tt>s don't move, so even when you press the <tt>Go</tt> button, nothing happens, but we'll do more interesting 'animals' in due time.</p>

<p>
The <tt>Critter</tt> class defines five constants for the various directions, and one additional constant for a list containing all five directions. <b>You can refer to these directly in your code</b> (<tt>critter.N</tt>, <tt>critter.C</tt>, <tt>critter.DIRECTIONS</tt>,
etc.) because you are inheriting from Critter (and importing critter). Referring to these constants is optional, however, since they can be freely changed by any program
capable of importing the critter.py module. In their place, you can refer to the specific values they represent--"CENTER" instead of critter.C, "NORTH" instead of critter.N, etc.
</p>

<h2>Critters to Implement</h2>

<p>
The following are the five critter classes you will implement.  Each class must have only one constructor and that 
constructor must accept exactly the parameter(s) described in the table.  For random moves, each possible choice must be 
equally likely. 
</p>

<h3>Mouse</h3><p>

<p>
<b><i>8 points, individual</b></i>
</p><center>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="80%">
		<tbody><tr>
			<td width="20%"><b>&nbsp;constructor</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;<tt>def __init__(self, x,y,color)</tt></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="20%"><b>&nbsp;stats</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;Attack: <tt>60</tt>, Defense: <tt>40</tt></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="20%"><b>&nbsp;color</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;the color passed to the constructor</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="20%"><b>&nbsp;movement</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;alternates between <tt>EAST</tt> and <tt>SOUTH</tt> in a zigzag pattern (first <tt>EAST</tt>, then <tt>SOUTH</tt>, then <tt>EAST</tt>, then <tt>SOUTH</tt>,...)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>&nbsp;character</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;<tt>'M'</tt></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</center>
 
<p>
The <tt>Mouse</tt> constructor accepts a parameter representing the color in which the Mouse should be drawn.  This color should 
be returned each time the <tt>getColor</tt> method is called on the <tt>Mouse</tt> (so, maybe you should store it somewhere).  For example, a <tt>Mouse</tt> constructed with a parameter 
value of <tt>color.RED</tt> will return <tt>color.RED</tt> from its <tt>getColor</tt>
method and will therefore appear red on the screen. Of course, it is 
the main program that will construct these mice, so you will have no 
control over what color each <tt>Mouse</tt> is displayed as. 
</p>

Note that the Mouse also accepts x and y parameters to its constructor.  All critters do this: If you are clever, you can update them in your getMove method to reflect where you currently are in the world.  This is unnecessary for Mouse, but may be very helpful for your own critter!<p>

<p>
Remember, the <tt>getMove</tt> method is called by the main program each
time the critter needs to move; you can use this information to keep 
track of whether it is time to move East or to move South.
</p>

<h3>Hippo</h3>
<p>
<b><i>8 points, individual</b></i>
</p><center>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="80%">
		<tbody><tr>
			<td width="20%"><b>&nbsp;constructor</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;<tt>def __init__(self, x,y,steps)</tt></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>&nbsp;stats</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;attack: <tt>80</tt>, defense: <tt>20</tt></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>&nbsp;color</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;<tt>color.BLUE</tt></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>&nbsp;movement</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;first go <tt>SOUTH</tt> <tt>steps</tt> times, then go <tt>WEST</tt> <tt>steps</tt> times, then go <tt>NORTH</tt> <tt>steps</tt> times, then go <tt>EAST</tt> <tt>steps</tt> times, then stay still <tt>steps</tt> times (a clockwise square pattern), then repeat</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>&nbsp;character</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;<tt>'H'</tt></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</center>
<p></p>

<p>
The <tt>Hippo</tt> constructor accepts a parameter representing the distance the Hippo will walk in each direction before 
changing direction.  For example, a <tt>Hippo</tt> constructed with a parameter value of 8 will walk 8 steps south, 8 steps 
west, 8 steps north, 8 steps east, stay still for 8 turns, and then repeat.  You can assume that the value passed for <tt>steps</tt> is at least 1. 
</p>

<h3>Lion</h3>
<p>
<b><i>8 points, partner</b></i>
</p><center>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="80%">
		<tbody><tr>
			<td width="20%"><b>&nbsp;constructor</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;<tt>def __init__(self,x,y)</tt></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>&nbsp;stats</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;attack: <tt>100</tt>, defense: <tt>0</tt></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>&nbsp;color</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;alternates between <tt>color.ORANGE</tt> and <tt>color.BLACK</tt> (first <tt>color.ORANGE</tt>, then <tt>color.BLACK</tt>, then ...)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>&nbsp;movement</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;looks one space <tt>NORTH</tt>, then one space <tt>EAST</tt>, then one space <tt>SOUTH</tt>, then one space <tt>WEST</tt>. If at any point it sees a critter that doesn't display as <tt>'S'</tt>, <tt>'T'</tt>, or a <tt>number</tt>, it attacks. Otherwise, returns a random direction other than <tt>CENTER</tt>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>&nbsp;character</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;<tt>'L'</tt></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</center>
<p></p>

<p>Hints: The <tt>isdigit()</tt> method of the string class can be called on a string to test if it's a number or not (to call it on string str, use <tt>str.isdigit()</tt>).  Also, <tt>random.choice(L)</tt> will return a random element of list L. The color needs to change based on how many <i>turns</i> the Lion has had - you can be confident that the getMove method will be called once per turn, but other methods such as getColor may not be. </p>

<p>
For the <tt>getMove</tt> method, you need to determine your opponent's display character. Every time a critter's <tt>getMove</tt> method is called, it is passed a parameter <tt>info</tt> of type <tt>YourCritterInfo</tt> that provides useful information about itself and its current surroundings. In particular, the <tt>YourCritterInfo</tt> contains the following functions:
</p>
<div class="boxed">
<pre><tt>
observation functions--call these with an a, b pair representing
how many squares to the left of and above your current position you
want to look, and they will return information about that square:
	
	getHealth(a, b): returns the health of the critter
	occupying the square, or 0 if the square is empty
	
	getStats(a, b): returns the stats of the critter
	occupying the square as an (attack, defense) tuple,
	or (0, 0) if the square is empty
	
	getChar(a, b): returns the character of the critter
	occupying the square, or '.' if the square is empty
	
	getColor(a, b): returns the color of the critter
	occupying the square, or color.BLACK if the square is empty
	
	getType(a, b): returns the class name (NOT the
	character) of the critter occupying the square,
	or '.' if the square is empty
	
	getSquare(a, b): returns an object of type TheirCritterInfo,
	which contains all the information of the above functions,
	but stored in a single variable for (potential) convenience</tt>
</pre>
</div>
<p>Thus, in the <tt>getMove</tt> method, the code <tt>info.getColor(0, 1)</tt> the color of the critter directly below it. Slightly less usefully, 
the code <tt>info.getType(0, 0)</tt> would return the class name of the current critter as it appears to others.
</p>

<p>
There is a vision limit on the observation functions--you cannot simply observe the entire board with a single critter. Instead,
each critter is limited to only observing the squares a distance of 3 or less away (calculated using Euclidean distance, or
<tt>sqrt(x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>) &lt;= 3</tt>).
</p>

<br>
<h3>The Chameleoturtle</h3>
<p>
<b><i>8 points, partner</b></i>
</p><center>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="80%">
		<tbody><tr>
			<td width="20%"><b>&nbsp;constructor</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;<tt>def __init__(self,x,y)</tt></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>&nbsp;stats</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;attack: <tt>50</tt>, defense: <tt>50</tt></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>&nbsp;color</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;the color of the last critter to attack it; if it hasn't been attacked yet, <tt>color.GREEN</tt></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>&nbsp;movement</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;if any critters it can see anywhere within its sights aren't other Chameleoturtles, Stones, or Point Caches, stays still. Otherwise, moves <tt>NORTH</tt></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>&nbsp;character</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;the character of the last critter to attack it; if it hasn't been attacked yet, <tt>'T'</tt></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</center>

<p>
To check everywhere in the chameleoturtle's sights, you will have to check up to 3 squares away in all of the cardinal directions, and Northwest, Northeast, Southeast and Southwest.  I recommend using a for loop, and computing the Euclidean distance to figure out if the chameleoturtle can "see" the square or not.<p>


Notice that the movement of the Chameleoturtle is not dependent on the <i>character</i> of its opponents, but of the <i>class</i>--code this correctly or points will be
taken off. 

Note that to get the character of the last critter to attack, you will need to implement the <tt>fightOver</tt> method.  Fight over will be called by the client whenever a fight ends.  It is passed oppInfo as a parameter.  oppInfo works just like accessing info for your neighbors - you can call oppInfo.getHealth() to get the health of the critter that attacked you, oppInfo.getChar() to get its character, and so on.

</p>

<h3>The &lt;YourName&gt; Creature</h3>
<p>
<b><i>8 points, partner</b></i>
</p><center>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="80%">
		<tbody><tr>
			<td width="20%"><b>&nbsp;constructor</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;<tt>def __init__(self,x,y)</tt></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>&nbsp;stats</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;you decide</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>&nbsp;color</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;you decide</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>&nbsp;movement</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;you decide</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>&nbsp;character</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;you decide</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</center>
<p></p>

<p>
You will decide the behaviour of the <tt>&lt;YourName&gt;</tt> class.  
(Your constructor must accept paramters self,x and y as shown above.)   Remember,
the format for naming your class should be your first name followed by 
your last initial.  My critter would be called <tt>CynthiaT</tt> in the file <tt>cynthiat.py</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Bonus Points</h2>

<p>
As the simulation progresses, there are a couple ways to earn points besides simply killing off opponents. There
is a bonus awarded every 100 rounds equal to one point for every critter still alive in each class, so longevity
might become a priority for you when designing your own.

Point Caches are another way to accrue bonus points. They have a 1 in 10 chance of appearing on the board every round,
and are worth between 1 and 9 points. To claim one, two critters of the same class must attack it consecutively. If
one of your critters attacks a Point Cache and then a Mouse happens to bump into it, you cannot claim it unless
both of your critters attack it again with no other interruptions. The only way to rid the board of a Point Cache is
to claim it; they cannot be killed or moved otherwise.
</p>

<h2>Your Own Critter Class</h2>

<p>
Part of your grade will be based upon writing creative and non-trivial behaviour in your critter class.  The following are 
some guidelines and hints about how to write an interesting critter. 
</p>

<p>
Although your stats cannot be changed once they are set in the beginning, not all of your critters have to be identical. Some
clever manipulation of class variables and a decent game plan will put you far ahead of other, less-sophisticated critters.
</p>

<p>
You can make your critter return any character you like from its <tt>getChar</tt> method and any color you like from the 
<tt>getColor</tt> method.  In fact, critters are asked what display color and character to use on each round of the simulation, so 
you can have a critter that displays itself differently over time.  Keep in mind that the <tt>getChar</tt> character is also passed to 
other animals when they fight your critter; you may wish to strategize to try to fool other animals. 
</p>

<p>
You'll notice some strange interactions occurring between Chameleoturtles and Lions--try to find a way to use this to your advantage!
</p>

<p>
It's worth it to point out that the <tt>color.py</tt> module has a <tt>getRandomColor</tt> function; feel free to use it as you
desire! Lastly, the color of a critter tends toward white as its health gets lower--your colors may appear lighter than expected;
this is the game showing you that your critters aren't faring too well.
</p>

<h3>Tournament!</h3>
<p>
Once you have all finished your lab, we will host a Critter tournament 
in class consisting of battles in the following format: Two or three students' 
critter classes will be placed into the simulator world along with the 
other standard animals (Stone, Mouse, Hippo, Lion, and Chameleoturtle), with 25 of 
each animal type. The simulator will be started and run until 150 moves have passed.
The student whose critter class has the highest score 
(other critters killed + your critters alive + bonus) wins the battle. The 
winner of the tournament will gain fame and fortune, as well as a 
super-secret prize.
</p>
